I am now a PhD candidate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The research areas that I am involved in and interested in include deep learning-based Computer Graphics and Computer Vision. Previously I was a Research Assistant in [Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence in Design (AiDLab)](https://www.aidlab.hk/en/), working with Prof [Calvin Wong](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/persons/wai-keung-wong-2). In 2020, I completed my Master's degree from Xidian University under the supervision of Prof [Rui Song](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/songrui/index.html). During my Master's, I visited the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) and Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data as a visiting student supervised by Dr [Xiaoguang Han](https://gaplab.cuhk.edu.cn/).
