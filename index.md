I am now a Research Assistant in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Previously I was a Research Assistant in [Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence in Design (AiDLab)](https://www.aidlab.hk/en/) Hong Kong, working with Prof [Calvin Wong](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/persons/wai-keung-wong-2). The research areas that I involved and interested include 3D Vision, Generative Algorithm and Fashion. In 2020, I completed my Mphil degree from Xidian University under the supervision of Prof [Rui Song](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/songrui/index.html). During my Mphil, I have visited the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) and Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data as a visiting student supervised by Dr [Xiaoguang Han](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/hanxiaoguang/)
